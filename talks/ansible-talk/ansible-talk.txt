What is Ansible?
   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

☑ Deployment
☑ Configuration
☑ Orchestration

@genesis.png

#Ansible project was born in February 2012.
#Lead by Michael DeHaan (@laserllama) former employee of Red Hat and Puppet.

⇒ Commercial entity AnsibleWorks(later Ansible, Inc.)
    sells "Tower" - a web UI for Ansible.
⇒ DeHaan departed the project in January 2015.
⇒ Red Hat acquires Ansible, Inc. October 2015.

Why Ansible?

My Scenario:
  - AWS,
  - GNU/Linux,
  - 3 tier web application
  - 10 devs, 1 sysadmin

Ansible peers:
  ☞ Chef
  ☞ Puppet
  ☞ SaltStack

Chef?

+1 Early to the party.
+1 Great community-built reusable recipes.
-1 Domain specific language (based on Ruby -1).
-1 Searchability terrible due to cooking analogy.
-1 Client/Server: Berkshelf? Librarian? Knife?

Puppet?

+1 Early to the party.
-1 Domain specific language (based on Ruby -1).
-1 Client/Server.

SaltStack?

+1 Can be run no-server.
+1 Python.
-1 Seemed somewhat incomplete on the
     deployment side to me at the time
     of evaluation.

Ansible!

+1 No server; SSH.
+1 No domain specific language.
     Straight YAML, straight Python
     if you want to get fancy.
+1 Active participatory community
     writing lots of modules / batteries included.
+1 Great documentation.
