Appleton Makerspace

What happens at a "makerspace"?
Woodworking, metalworking, sewing,
weaving, 3D printing, art, music,
electronics, welding, socializing,
learning, programming, entrepreneurism,
and obviously fun!

Coder Cooperative

We will meet weekly on Monday evenings
7pm-9pm for the betterment of people
endeavoring to learn and explore the
domain of software development. Both
makerspace members and public are welcome.
Donations appreciated.
