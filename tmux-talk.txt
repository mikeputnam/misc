tmux is a terminal multiplexer. What is a terminal multiplexer?

    tmux lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal,
    detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a
    different terminal. And do a lot more. See the manual.

    tmux runs on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux and OS X and may still run on
    Solaris and AIX (although they haven't been tested in a while).

Structure:

    tmux
    |
    +---session(s)

        +---window(s)
            |
            +---pane(s)

First things to know:

    The man page is the hands down best source of information.

    $ man tmux

    You interact with tmux via a "prefix". tmux listens for the prefix followed
    by your command.

    The default prefix is "Ctrl-b". Hereafter referred to as C-b.

    Some commands use C-b followed by the "Meta" key (alt by default).

Run tmux with:

    $ tmux

Default keybinds I use a lot:

    C-b ?           List all bound keybinds.
    C-b d           Detach from the tmux session leaving it running in the
                    background.
    C-c             Create a new window.
    C-b l (lower L) Return to the last window you were looking at.
    C-b "           Split the current window/pane into another pane.
    C-b 1           Switch to window #1, #2, etc.
    C-b z           In a multipaned window, zoom into the active pane so it
                    fills the window.
    C-b q           In a multipaned window, display a number in each pane that
                    can then be pressed to jump focus on that pane.    
    C-b M-1 to M-5  Toggle one of the five preset layouts: even-horizontal,
                    even-vertical, main-horizontal, main-vertical, or tiled.
    C-b ,           Rename window.
    C-b :           Issue a tmux function
    C-b M-<arrow>   Resize a pane using the arrow keys.

Functions I use a lot and have mapped to keybinds in my .tmux.conf:

    send-prefix         Useful for interacted with nested tmux sessions.
    synchronize-panes   I have this set as a toggle to quickly jump between
                        wanting to issue the same command to all panes and only
                        wanting to interact with one pane.
    source-file         Activate a file containing tmux commands. Useful when
                        want to do seldom-performed tmux tasks that don't
                        belong in your default tmux arrangement.
